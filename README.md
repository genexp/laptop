Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

2) Set zsh as your login shell.

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

Install
-------

Run the script:

    zsh <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/mattbanks/laptop/master/mac)

What it sets up
---------------

* Ack for finding things in files
* Bundler gem for managing Ruby libraries
* Homebrew for managing operating system libraries
* Git, because you need version control, homie
* Grunt for all of its awesomeness
* Node for running a JS based server
* Rails gem for writing web applications

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).
